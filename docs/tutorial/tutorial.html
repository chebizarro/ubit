<p>
The following steps show how to create a simple text editor.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: A Simple application: sedit1.cpp</h3>
<p>
This section  shows how to create a Ubit application. This application creates 
a main window that contains a multiline text editing widget
(source code in file: <a href="sedit1.cpp">sedit1.cpp</a>) 
<p>
<!--
<i>Note: this source code uses some typical features of the C++ language. If you
not very familiar with C++ you should have a look at [sedit1bis.cpp], an equivalent
program written in a Java like style.</i>
-->

<pre>
#include &lt;ubit/ubit.hpp>
using namespace ubit;

class SEdit : public UFrame {
public:
  SEdit();
private:
  UTextarea textbox;    // the text area widget
  UStr      content;    // the string contained in the textbox
};
</pre>
<p>
The first thing to do is to include the <b>ubit header</b> and tell
the compiler that we will use the <b>ubit namespace</b>.
We can now define <em>SEdit</em>, the main class of our application. 
It derives from <b>UFrame</b> which 
is the class for <b>toplevel windows</b>. SEdit have two variables.
<ul> 
<li><em>UTextArea textbox</em> : a multiline text editing widget</li>
<li><em>UStr content</em> : a Ubit string object that will contain the text edited in 'textbox'</li>
</ul>
<p>
These variables are not pointers but C++ "plain" objects (which means
that the variables contain the object instead of pointing to it). 
These objects are automatically 
created and initialized when an instance of SEdit is created. 
This syntax is typical of C++ but does not exist in Java (we should use pointers 
and the <b>new</b> primitive to create each object). We'll see how to use C++ pointers in
a safe way at a later stage.
</p>
<pre>
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  UAppli appli(argc, argv);
 
  SEdit sedit;
  appli.add(sedit);
  sedit.show();
 
  return appli.start();
}
</pre>
The main() function performs the following actions:
<ul>
<li>
<em>UAppli</em>, 
the Application Context is created first. The UAppli must be created as soon
as possible, typically at the beginning of the main() function. It parses 
<b>argv</b>
that contains the
arguments of the command line that launched the program. 
The UAppli retrieves Ubit and X window 
options and removes them from argv (<b>argc</b> the argument count is decremented)
</li>
<p><li>
<em>SEdit sedit</em> :
creates a SEdit instance (and the nested instances of 'textbox' and 'content'
as explained above). Again, 'sedit' and 'appli' are plain objects rather than pointers.
</li>
<p><li>
<em>appli.add(sedit)</em> :  
adds the 'sedit' instance to the application context. As SEdit derives from 
<b>UFrame</b> it will be the <b>main frame</b> of the application. 
</li>
<p><li>
<em>sedit.show()</em> : 
computes the layout of 'sedit' and its children and makes them visible. Note that
frames (and other windows) are not visible until their show() method is called.
</li>
<p><li>
<em>return appli.start()</em> : starts the <b>main event loop</b>.
The main loop will run until exit() or <em>UAppli::quit(status)</em>
is called. 'status' is returned by start() when quit() is called.
'status' is a positive or null int that serves as a termination status(a value
of 0 means OK, a value that is > 0 indicates an error). 
</li>
</ul>
We must now write the body of the SEdit constructor:
<pre>
SEdit::SEdit() {	
  content = "Editable text";
  textbox.add(content);
  this->addlist( uwidth(400) + uheight(300) + textbox);
}
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
<em>content = "Editable text"</em> : 
assigns "Editable text" to the 'content' string (which is initially empty)
</li>
<p><li>
<em>textbox.add(content)</em> : 
adds the 'content' string to the 'textbox' widget. Ubit makes it possible 
to add a string
(or any other object that derive from UBrick) to any widget. The default behavior
is to display the string inside the widget. However, because 'textbox' is
a <b>UTextarea</b> widget it will also makes it possible to edit this string
interactively.
</li>
<p><li>
<em>addlist (uwidth(400) + uheight(300) + textbox)</em> : 
adds 3 objects to 'this' (which is  the 'sedit' instance being built). 
This syntax, which is typical of the Ubit toolkit,
is equivalent to:
<pre>
add(uwidth(400)); add(uheight(300)); add(textbox);
</pre>
It's purpose is to make the source code more compact. Note how the <b><em>+ operator</em></b>
is used to create the <b>argument list</b> that is given to <em>addlist()</em>.
The only difference between add() and addlist() is that add() can only have one 
object as an argument.
</li>
<br>

<li>
<em>uwidth()</em> and <em>uheight()</em> create <b>Property objects</b> that specify 
the size (in pixels) of the widget they are added to. <em>uwidth(400)</em> is <b>shortcut</b> for <em>*new UWidth(400)</em>. 
Again, this syntax is typical of the toolkit and
it's purpose is to make the source code more compact. Most Ubit objects
can be created in a similar way (by calling a shorcut function instead of
the <b>new</b> primitive). Hence:

<pre>addlist(uwidth(400) + uheight(300) + textbox);</pre>
is just a shorter way to write:
<pre>
    add(*new UWidth(400)); 
    add(*new UHeight(300)); 
    add(textbox);
</pre>

<li>
Finally 'textbox' is added to 'this' (the SEdit instance) as a child. The effect of this childhood relationship is that 'textbox' will appear inside 'sedit'. <b>Layout management</b> is performed automatically in Ubit interfaces (the sizes and the positions of the widgets are computed automatically). However, it is sometimes
useful to specify the size or the position of a widget, as in this example where
we want the SEdit frame to have a given size.
</li>
</ul>
<nr>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h3>Step 2: Properties: sedit2.cpp</h3>
<p>
This example shows how to define widget properties such as the size, the scale,
the font, the background and foreground colors, etc.
(source code in file: <a href="sedit2.cpp">sedit2.cpp</a>) 

<p>
We introduced the UWidth and UHeight properties in the previous section 
to specify the size of the main frame:
<pre>
  addlist(uwidth(400) + uheight(300) + textbox);
</pre>
First, it is important to notice that we can add properties to widgets by using
the add() and the addlist() methods. In fact, these methods can be used to add
almost any Ubit object to a widget 
<p>
Second, a major feature of the Ubit toolkit is that <b>widgets don't have properties
of their own</b>. This is very different from a toolkit such as Java Swing where most
widgets have their own font, foreground and backround color, etc. Ubit widgets are
just very ligthweithed "empty" containers. Their default appearence is specified
by their <b>style</b> (each widget class is associated to a UStyle object that 
defines its appearance). Besides, graphical properties, such as the font or the
foreground color, are often inherited from the parents of the widget (styles
also define which properties are inherited). 
<p>
<b>This model is very similar to XML or HTML</b>. For instance a &lt;p> 
or a &lt;h1> nodes have default apperances in HTML. This can be modified by 
changing their style or by adding attributes to them. Ubit widgets work exactly 
in the same way: to change a widget appearance, one can modify its associated 
UStyle or just <b>add properties</b> to it as in the following example:
<pre>
  textbox.addlist(UFont::bold + UColor::red + UBgcolor::yellow + content);
</pre>
This source code adds 3 properties to 'textbox'. They specify
its font, its foreground color and its background color. <em>UFont::bold</em>,
<em>UColor::red</em> and <em>UBgcolor::yellow</em> are predefined constants 
of the <b>UFont</b>, <b>UColor</b> and <b>UBgcolor</b> classes. Of course,
we could also use instances of these classes as we did before with <b>UWidth</b>
and <b>UHeight</b>; for instance:
<pre>
  textbox.addlist(ucolor("pink") + uscale(2.5) + content);
</pre>
which is equivalent to:
<pre>
  textbox.addlist(*new UColor("pink") + *new UScale(2.5) + content);
</pre>
Colors can be specified from predefined constants, color names or RGB values
(see class <b>UColor</b>). The <b>UBgcolor::none</b> constant specifies that the 
widget is fully transparent. The <b>UAlpha</b> property controls its level of 
transparency. The <b>UBackground</b> property associates a background image or
a pattern to the widget.
<p>
<b>UScale</b> is another interesting property which specifies the scale of the
widget. Its argument is the magnifying factor that is applied to the object.
A value &lt; 1 reduces its size, a value > 1 increases it (note that this value
should be positive).
<p>
Of course, properties can also be <b>variables</b>. This is what we are going to do now 
so that we will be able to change the properties of the 'textbox' widget interactively
(this will be done in the next section when we see callbacks). Here is the new
definition od class SEdit:
<pre>
class SEdit : public UFrame {
public:
  SEdit();
private:
  UTextarea textbox;
  UStr      content;
  <em>UFont     font;
  UColor    color;
  UBgcolor  bgcolor;
  UScale    scale;</em>
};
</pre>
And the new version of its constructor:
<pre>
SEdit::SEdit() {	
  content = "Editable text";
  <em>font = UFont::bold;
  color.set(255, 0, 0);   // RGB spec
  bgcolor = UBgcolor::yellow;
  scale = 2.5;
  textbox.addlist(font + color + bgcolor + scale + content);</em>
  addlist( uwidth(400) + uheight(300) + textbox);
}
</pre>
<b>Final remarks</b>: Properties have many other interesting features:
<ul>
<li> they <b>can be shared by several widgets</b>. All of them will be 
automatically updated when the property is changed.

<p><li>  <b>order matters </b> because argument lists are evaluated in the 
left-to-right order. This means that properties must usually be located
<b>at the beginning</b> of arguments list as in:
<pre>
  textbox.addlist(<em>font + color + bgcolor + scale</em> + content);
  addlist(<em>uwidth(400) + uheight(300)</em> + textbox);
</pre>

<p><li> As an exception to the previous rule, left-to-right evaluation can 
be used to create <b>multi colored, multi font text</b> in a simple way:
<pre>
  textbox.addlist(<em>UFont::bold + UColor::red </em>+ "abcd" 
                  + <em>UColor::blue + UFont::italic</em> + "xyz");
</pre>
The rule is quite simple: properties take effect on whatever follows them
in the list. This example also shows that a widget can contain <b>several
strings</b> (strings can either be <b>char*</b> C strings of Ubit 
<b>UStr</b> strings). 
</ul>

Finally, the Ubit tookit also provides more sophisticated features such as
<b>attribute lists</b> and the ability to create <b>multimedia and hypermedia
documents</b> that combines images, multiformatted text and hyperlinks.
These capabilities will be shown in another section.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: Callback functions and methods: sedit3.cpp</h3>
<p>
This example shows how to define callback functions and callback methods 
Note that this example has an ugly layout. This problem
will ne solved in the next section.
(source code in file: <a href="sedit3.cpp">sedit3.cpp</a>) 

<p>
The declaration of the <em>SEdit</em> class contains what precedes plus:
<pre>
class SEdit : public UFrame {
  ....                        // same as above
  <em>void setFont(UFont*);</em>
};

<em>void showMsg(const char* msg)</em> {
  cout << "message " << msg << endl;
}
</pre>
<em>setFont()</em> ia a callback <b>method</b> that will change the font  
of the 'textbox'. <em>showMsg()</em> is a callback <b>function</b> that will
print some useful message on the terminal. Here is the beginning of
the new definition of the SEdit constructor:
<pre>
SEdit::SEdit() {	
  content = "Editable text";
  textbox.addlist(font + color + bgcolor + scale + content);
  
  <em>UBox& font_box = uhbox 
    (UPix::edit + "Font: "
     + ubutton("Bold"   + ucall(this, &UFont::bold,   &SEdit::setFont))
     + ubutton("Italic" + ucall(this, &UFont::italic, &SEdit::setFont))
     + ubutton("Normal" + ucall(this, &UFont::normal, &SEdit::setFont))
     );</em>
</pre>
First,  <em>UBox&amp; font_box = uhbox( ... )</em> creates a new <b>UHbox</b>
object. UHbox is a horizontal box (<b>UVbox</b> is a vertical box). This expression
is equivalent to:  <em>UBox&amp; font_box = *new UHbox( ... )</em>.
<p>
<em>UBox&amp; font_box</em> is not
an instance variable of SEdit but a local variable of the constructor, because
there is no need to keep track of it after initialisation time. As for the
addlist() method, The <em>uhbox( )</em>
shortcut function (and the <em>UHbox( )</em> constructor) can take a <b>+list</b>
as an argument. This +list contains:
<ul>
<li>
UPix::edit : a predefined pixmap image 
<li>
"Font: " : a character string
<li>
ubutton( ... ) : three push buttons (UButton is the class for push buttons)
</ul>
Each button contains;
<ul>
<li>
a character string that will be the name of this button
<li>
a ucall( ... ) expression that specifies the callback method that is called
when the button is activated and its arguments. For instance: 
<pre>
ucall(this, &UFont::bold, &SEdit::setFont)
</pre>
means that: <em>this->setFont (&amp;UFont::bold)</em> will be called when the button is activated.
</ul>
As <em>setFont</em> is a SEdit <b>method</b>, the first argument of the ucall 
expression must be a SEdit instance.
The second argument is given as a parameter to the setFont() method. A <b>callback 
method</b>, such as setFont, can have 0 to 2 parameters (instead of 1 in this example).
The number and the type of the arguments given to the ucall expression 
must match with those of the called method, or the program won't compile.
</ul>
Here is the second part of the SEdit constructor:
<pre>
  UBox& color_box = uhbox
    (UPix::colors + "Colors: "
     + ubutton("Red"   + uset(&color, &UColor::red))
     + ubutton("Blue"  + uset(&color, &UColor::blue))
     + ubutton("Green" + uset(&color, &UColor::green))
     );
</pre>
This piece of code is similar to the previous one except that we use
the <em>uset( )</em> construct. uset( ) is shortcut that calls the <b>set( )</b>
method of its argument. For instance:
<pre>
uset(&color, &UColor::red)
</pre>
means that: <em>color->set (&amp;UColor::red)</em> will be called when the button is activated. Obviously, this constructs will only work is the the first argument
of uset() has a set() method. Note that we could also have use uset() in the
previous case.
<p>
The last part of the SEdit constructor is:
<pre>
  UBox& event_box = uhbox 
    (UPix::edit + "Font: " xxxxxxx
     + ubutton("Event test"
                + ucall(this, &UFont::bold,   &SEdit::setFont))
     + ubutton("Italic" + ucall(this, &UFont::italic, &SEdit::setFont))
     + ubutton("Normal" + ucall(this, &UFont::normal, &SEdit::setFont))
     );

  addlist
    (uwidth(400) + uheight(300) 
    + textbox + font_box + color_box + event_box
  );
  }
</pre>
(to be continued)
<br>

<h3>Step 4: Layout</h3>
<p>
Examples <a href="sedit4.cpp">sedit4.cpp</a>
and <a href="LayoutAndText.cpp">LayoutAndText.cpp</a> shows how to create
editable text and how to specify simple layout constraints.
<br>
The main frame contains 3 parts: a tool bar, a text area contained in a scroll pane
and status bar.
These 3 elements are flexible in the horizontal direction. The scroll pane is
also flexible in the vertical dimension. These behaviors are specified by inserting
uhflex(), utop(), uvflex(), ubottom() in the child list of the UFrame.
<p>
The tool bar contains a text field with an editable string.
This text is appended to the central text area when pressing the Return key
or clicking the "Ok" button.
